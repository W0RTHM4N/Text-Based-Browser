# Text-Based Browser
My 8th Python project from Hyperskill.

This program shows user the text contents of the page on the inputed url with hyperlinks printed in blue color, simultaneously saving it to a file with corresponding name.

The program requires one command-line argument which will be the name of the directory for saved pages.
Then the program is expecting the page url or one of the following commands as input:
- "back" shows the previously opened web-page;
- "exit" stops the execution of the program.
